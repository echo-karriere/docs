# Resources

- **JetBrains**: Get the [JetBrains Student][jetbrains] so you have all their
  products for free.
- **GitHub**: Get the [GitHub Student Pack][github-student] as it gives you tons
  of free resources.
- **Kotlin**: Do [Kotlin Koans][koans] in IntelliJ.
- **PostgreSQL**: Basically INF115, Google is SQL's best friend. You should also
  take a look at [Exposed][exposed] as we use it as our SQL framework of choice
- **React**: Trial by fire, the [React Tutorial][react-tut] is a small and nice
  introduction. You can and should also take a look at [Frontend
  Masters][frontendmaster] that you get via the GitHub Student Pack for a ton
  courses on everything frontend.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: [You Don't Know JS][youdontknowjs] is a good
  introduction to modern JavaScript. As for TypeScript you might be able to
  guess that it's a strict syntactical superset that adds statical typing to JS.
  Their [documentation][typescript] is great, though you can also use
  [TypeScript Deep Dive][typescript-deep].
- **GraphQL**: A good introduction can be found in their
  [documentation][graphql]. If you want to try it out there's a bunch of example
  API you can use, for example [Star Wars API][swapi].
- **Git**: A good introduction for how to develop with Git is [Learn Git
  Branching][learn-git]. You should also read the short introduction to [Trunk
  Based Development][trunk] for an overview of how we want to work.
- **Docker**: There's a sweet and short [introduction][docker] on their
  websites, though I recommend at least skimming [Docker Curriculum][docker-cur]
  (especially the Multi Container Environments section).
